# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 11, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how we handles information when you use our suite of browser extensions (collectively, the "Services").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our core philosophy is based on **local processing**, meaning your sensitive data should remain on your device whenever possible.

This policy applies to the following extensions:
* Private Local Translator for Discord™
* Private Local Translator for WhatsApp™ Web
* Inline Translator for Reddit™
* LLM Prompt Optimizer for ChatGPT™

By installing or using these extensions, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 2. Our Core Principle: Local Data Processing

**The most important thing to know about our Services is that we prioritize local processing.**

Unlike traditional translation services that send your text to remote cloud servers, our extensions are designed to utilize on-device AI capabilities built into your browser (such as Chrome's Gemini Nano) or other local models.

**What this means for you:**
* **Your Chats Stay Private:** The content of the messages, posts, or prompts you translate (your input text) and the translated results (output text) are processed directly on your computer.
* **No Data Collection by Us:** We do **not** collect, store, view, or transmit the content of your communications to our servers.

## 3. Information Collection and Use

We collect minimal information necessary to provide the functionality of the extensions.

### A. Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be explicit about what we do not handle:
* We do **not** collect your personal information (name, email, phone number).
* We do **not** collect the content of your private messages on WhatsApp, Discord, or your prompts on ChatGPT.
* We do **not** track your browsing history outside of the specific platforms the extensions operate on.

### B. Information Stored Locally on Your Device

To function correctly, the extensions need to store certain preferences locally within your browser's storage mechanism (e.g., `chrome.storage.local`). This data never leaves your device:
* **User Preferences:** Settings such as your preferred target language, display mode choices (e.g., "Double View" or "Inline"), and keyboard shortcut configurations.
* **Third-Party API Keys (Optional):** If you voluntarily choose to use external translation engines (see Section 4 below), your personal API keys are stored securely on your local device.

### C. Anonymous Usage Data (Browser Standard)

We may receive aggregated, anonymous technical data provided automatically by the browser's web store platform (e.g., the Chrome Web Store dashboard). This includes non-personally identifiable information such as:
* Total number of active users.
* Geographic region (aggregate level).
* Browser language and version.

This aggregated data is used solely to analyze general usage trends and improve the performance of our Services.

## 4. Third-Party Services (Optional Features)

Our extensions primarily use Local AI. However, we offer power users the *option* to connect external third-party services for enhanced translation capabilities (e.g., DeepL API or Google Gemini API).

**If, and only if, you voluntarily choose to input your personal API key for these services:**

* Your input text will be sent directly from your browser to the respective third-party service provider to generate the translation.
* This data transmission is governed by the privacy policy of that third-party provider.
* We do not have access to your API keys or the data you send to these services.

We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these optional third parties:
* [DeepL Privacy Policy](https://www.deepl.com/privacy)
* [Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms)

## 5. Data Security

Because we do not collect or store your personal message data on our servers, the security of your data depends primarily on the security of your local device and browser.

For data stored locally (like settings or optional API keys), we rely on the secure storage mechanisms provided by the modern web browsers where the extension is installed.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
